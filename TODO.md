## üìù Development Notes

### Technology Stack Decisions:
- **Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui ‚úÖ
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with httpOnly cookies
- **File Storage**: Local file system (simple)
- **Caching**: Redis for sessions (optional)
- **Deployment**: Simple Docker Compose for self-hosting

### Development Best Practices:
1. Start with Phase 1 and complete each phase fully before moving to the next
2. Write tests as you go, not after
3. Use TypeScript strictly - no `any` types
4. Follow REST API conventions
5. Implement proper error handling from the beginning
6. Use database transactions for data consistency
7. Regular commits with clear messages
8. Document API endpoints as you build them

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Start with Phase 1.1**: Setup PostgreSQL database and Prisma
2. **Create basic API structure**: Start with auth endpoints
3. **Test each API endpoint**: Use Postman or similar
4. **Update frontend incrementally**: Replace mock data piece by piece
5. **Focus on security**: Don't skip authentication middleware
