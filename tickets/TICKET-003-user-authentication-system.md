# TICKET-003: User Authentication System

## Metadata
- **Epic**: Phase 1 - Backend Foundation & Authentication
- **Story Points**: 21
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Feature
- **Status**: Backlog
- **Sprint**: 1-2

## User Story
As a **family member**, I want to **register and login to the application** so that **I can access my family's wishlist system securely**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can register with email and password with email verification
- [ ] User can login with email and password
- [ ] User can logout from the application
- [ ] User is redirected to main page (/) after successful login
- [ ] "Remember me" option provides extended session (30 days vs 7 days)
- [ ] Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- [ ] JWT access tokens (30 minutes) with refresh tokens (7-30 days)
- [ ] Authentication middleware protects routes
- [ ] Frontend auth pages connect to real API
- [ ] User session persists across browser refreshes
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login when unauthenticated
- [ ] Automatic token refresh before expiration
- [ ] Password reset functionality via email
- [ ] Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts (15 minutes)
- [ ] Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

## Technical Requirements
- Implement JWT-based authentication with httpOnly cookies
- Use dual-token strategy: short-lived access tokens (30 min) + refresh tokens (7-30 days)
- Use bcrypt for password hashing (cost factor 12)
- Create authentication middleware for protected routes
- Implement proper session management with token rotation
- Follow security best practices for authentication
- Handle authentication errors gracefully
- Implement account lockout mechanism
- Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Email verification for new accounts
- Password strength validation
- Remember me functionality with extended sessions

## API Endpoints to Create
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration with email verification
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login with remember me option
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout (invalidate refresh token)
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh access token
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user profile
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Password reset completion
- `POST /api/auth/verify-email` - Email verification
- `POST /api/auth/change-password` - Password change for authenticated users

## Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update `app/auth/page.tsx` to use real API endpoints
- [ ] Add "Remember me" checkbox to login form
- [ ] Implement redirect to main page (/) after successful login
- [ ] Replace mock authentication with real API calls
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Create protected route wrapper component
- [ ] Add authentication context for global state management
- [ ] Implement automatic token refresh logic
- [ ] Add password strength indicator
- [ ] Create forgot password flow UI
- [ ] Add email verification success/pending states

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All authentication API endpoints implemented and tested
- [ ] Frontend authentication flows working end-to-end
- [ ] User sessions persist correctly with automatic refresh
- [ ] Protected routes enforce authentication
- [ ] Remember me functionality working correctly
- [ ] Login redirects to main page (/) successfully
- [ ] Password security requirements met (strength validation)
- [ ] Account lockout mechanism implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting active on auth endpoints
- [ ] Email verification flow complete
- [ ] Password reset flow complete
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Authentication state management implemented
- [ ] Security headers implemented

## Dependencies
- TICKET-001 (Database Schema Setup)
- TICKET-002 (API Infrastructure Setup)

## Security Requirements
- Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- Access tokens expire after 30 minutes, refresh tokens after 7-30 days
- Remember me extends refresh token to 30 days (vs 7 days default)
- Implement rate limiting: 5 login attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- Account lockout: 5 failed attempts locks account for 15 minutes
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use httpOnly cookies for token storage
- Implement CSRF protection
- Add security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
- Password strength requirements: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars
- Email verification required for new accounts
- Token rotation on refresh

## Notes
- Follow OWASP authentication guidelines
- Ensure proper error handling without information leakage
- Implement comprehensive logging for security events
- Consider implementing progressive web app (PWA) features for better mobile experience
- Email templates should be responsive and branded
- Token refresh should be seamless to user experience
- Remember me state should be clearly indicated in UI
- Successful login should redirect to intended page or main page (/) as fallback

## Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Core authentication (register, login, logout, me, refresh)
2. **Phase 2**: Remember me functionality and redirect logic
3. **Phase 3**: Email verification and password reset
4. **Phase 4**: Security enhancements (rate limiting, account lockout)
5. **Phase 5**: Password strength validation and enhanced UX
