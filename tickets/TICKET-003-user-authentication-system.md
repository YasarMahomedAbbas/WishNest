# TICKET-003: User Authentication System

## Metadata
- **Epic**: Phase 1 - Backend Foundation & Authentication
- **Story Points**: 13
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Feature
- **Status**: Backlog
- **Sprint**: 1-2

## User Story
As a **family member**, I want to **register and login to the application** so that **I can access my family's wishlist system securely**.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can register with email and password
- [ ] User can login with email and password
- [ ] User can logout from the application
- [ ] Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt
- [ ] JWT tokens are used for session management
- [ ] Authentication middleware protects routes
- [ ] Frontend auth pages connect to real API
- [ ] User session persists across browser refreshes
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login when unauthenticated

## Technical Requirements
- Implement JWT-based authentication with httpOnly cookies
- Use bcrypt for password hashing (cost factor 12)
- Create authentication middleware for protected routes
- Implement proper session management
- Follow security best practices for authentication
- Handle authentication errors gracefully

## API Endpoints to Create
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user profile

## Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update `app/auth/page.tsx` to use real API endpoints
- [ ] Replace mock authentication with real API calls
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Create protected route wrapper component
- [ ] Add authentication context for global state management

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All authentication API endpoints implemented and tested
- [ ] Frontend authentication flows working end-to-end
- [ ] User sessions persist correctly
- [ ] Protected routes enforce authentication
- [ ] Password security requirements met
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Authentication state management implemented

## Dependencies
- TICKET-001 (Database Schema Setup)
- TICKET-002 (API Infrastructure Setup)

## Security Requirements
- Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours
- Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use httpOnly cookies for JWT storage

## Files to Create/Modify
- `app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
- `app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- `app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`
- `app/api/auth/me/route.ts`
- `lib/auth.ts` - Authentication utilities
- `middleware.ts` - Route protection middleware
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication context
- `app/auth/page.tsx` - Update existing auth page

## Notes
- Follow OWASP authentication guidelines
- Ensure proper error handling without information leakage
- Consider implementing password strength requirements
