## Ticket Status Workflow
1. **Backlog**: Not yet started
2. **Ready**: Requirements clarified, ready to start
3. **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
4. **Review**: Code review and testing
5. **Done**: Completed and deployed

## Priority Levels
- **High**: Must have for MVP (Sprints 1-3)
- **Medium**: Important for full release (Sprint 4+)
- **Low**: Nice to have features (Future phases)

## Development Guidelines
1. Complete tickets in dependency order
2. Test each ticket thoroughly before marking as done
3. Update ticket status as work progresses
4. Add notes for any deviations from original requirements
5. Reference ticket numbers in git commits

## MVP Completion Criteria
After completing Sprints 1-3, the application should have:
- ✅ User authentication and registration
- ✅ Family creation and member management
- ✅ Full wishlist CRUD operations
- ✅ Item reservation system
- ✅ Basic deployment capability

This represents a fully functional family wishlist application ready for self-hosting.

## Next Steps
1. Start with TICKET-001 (Database Schema Setup)
2. Follow sprint order for optimal development flow
3. Update this index as new tickets are created
4. Track progress and adjust story point estimates based on actual completion times
